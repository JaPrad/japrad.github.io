I'm jobless at present. Enjoying the last few days of my vacations; the calm before the storm of a new semester at the university begins.

#### Past

I was an intern at the [Centre of Financial Accountability](https://www.cenfa.org).
My work included collecting data from existing research and government reports; which was used to aid the organization's efforts to raise public awareness on rising economic inequality in India. 

I've been a part time developer at [AfterBoards](https://www.afterboards.in), where I created [an interactive section](https://www.afterboards.in/flashcards) of their website, and developed some in-house softwares.
