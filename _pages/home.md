#### Hey, I'm Jyotiraditya

I'm an Economics undergrad at [Azim Premji University, Bengaluru](https://azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in). 
My fascination lies at the intersection of computation and economics - stuff like agent based models, machine learning & networks. 
I'm also interested in research related to development, poverty and inequality. 

This site is my island on the internet. It is a work in progress, so do check it out at a later date.

Or better, connect with me at [japrad26@gmail.com](mailto:japrad26@gmail.com), or on [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jyotiraditya-pradhan-507858235/) :) <br>
P.S. I love to talk!
