### Hey, I'm Jyotiraditya

I'm an Economics undergrad at [Azim Premji University, Bengaluru](https://azimpremjiuniversity.edu.in). 
And I love to code.
Naturally, my fascination lies at the intersection of computation and economics. 
I'm also interested in research related to development, poverty and inequality. 

I'm currently an intern at the [Centre for Financial Accountability](https://cenfa.org), where I work on understanding the implications of economic inequality in India.
My role includes collecting, analyzing and making visualizations of data from existing research and government reports.

P.S. I love to talk.
